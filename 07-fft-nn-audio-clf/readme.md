Please download the dataset for this project from [this link](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound8k.html).
Please also do a small amount of research on the urbansound8k dataset so you are familiar with the problem domain for this lesson.

In this project, we will be classifying sound waves with a variety of methods.
We will be combining many of the skills we've aquired in this lesson, adding very little on top.
Combining all of the tools you've aquired thus far will prove to be the greatest challange in this lesson I think.

Assuming you've already downloaded the dataset for this lesson, please proceed to `viz.py` to take a look at the dataset.

One of the most important skills of a data scientist (or anyone employing machine learning) is feature engineering.
This involves deciding which features are relevant, and therefor which features the model should concern itself with.
For example, let us look at a single audio sample:
