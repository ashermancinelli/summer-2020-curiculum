### Assignment 1: Overview of the Field

Please read through [this link](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee269/Lecture1.pdf) and take note
of what you have been exposed to and what you have not. You'll have to become quite comfortable
with linear algebra concepts.

In this directory, I've attached some scripts which demonstrate linear algebra concepts and
how to use some common libraries.

Please make note of what you understand and what you don't. Perhaps write down some
questions that you have and some explanations for what you do understand.
