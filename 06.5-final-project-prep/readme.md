For this lesson, simply write a paragraph or so outlining your plan for the ultimate and penultimate lessons.
They can be brief and are very subject to change.
Ideally, these lessons are significant enough and specific enough to your intended field of expertise that you would want these on your resume.
Be comfortable in the area of specialization you choose.
Spend ample time studying, reading the academic literature on the topic, and experimenting yourself.
