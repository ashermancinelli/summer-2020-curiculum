### Autoregressive Models

Autoregressive models predict unknown data points for a continuous variable
based on known discrete data points.
I believe [these slides](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee269/Lecture12.pdf)
to be very helpful in understanding the material, though not as applicable. Please
read through the slides and then find `autoreg.py` in this directory.

We will come back to this dataset when we discuss gaussian processes.
