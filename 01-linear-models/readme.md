### Assignment 1: Overview of the Field

Please read through [this link](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee269/Lecture1.pdf) and take note
of what you have been exposed to and what you have not. You'll have to become quite comfortable
with linear algebra concepts.

In this directory, I've attached some scripts which demonstrate linear algebra concepts and
how to use some common libraries.

Please make note of what you understand and what you don't. Perhaps write down some
questions that you have and some explanations for what you do understand.

`gen_data.py` is exemplary of how we will work with numpy to use/generate data. Familiarize
yourself with the library, as we will be using it often.

`matmul.py` contains some examples of computing least-squares over a relationshiop.
There you will also find your first assignment. I don't expect it to be challanging,
so please take your time and experiment often. Attempt to complete the challange at the
end of the script.

### Problems

1. Perform the following operations with numpy arrays:
  - Matrix-vector multiplication
  - Vector-matrix multiplication
  - Matrix-matrix multiplication
  - Create an array of x values using `np.linspace` and create a set of y values
    using a list comprehension
  - Plot your function
2. Reference `matmul.py`:
  - Solve the linear systems at the end of the script
  - Solve the linear system described on the first page of [this link](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf)
