### Classification

Classification is the process of 'binning' a datum. We will train models
to 'bin' our data based on training data. We will primarily use the
[Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

The first classifier we will use is a support vector machine. This
method creates 'supporting vectors' which bound each data cluster.
